# Turn-The-Bus-Project


# Getting started
- Clone the repo 
- First install unity hub(you might have to register on unity hub for the same)
- From unityhub install editor version 2023.2.0b17 (Intel Beta)
- Create a project in unity hub
- Open your cloned project folder(you will realise this is a 3D mobile project in unity)
- Click on the play button in top/center to see the currently created demo
- We use git for version tracking code(not the default unity version controller)
