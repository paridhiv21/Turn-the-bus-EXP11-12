Case object at infinitiy the image is point sized,inverted, real.

Case object beyond 2F the image is inverted, smaller, real.

Case object at 2F the image is Inverted, same sized, real.

Case object between F and 2F the image is enlarged, inverted, real.

Case object at F the image is infinetly large, inverted, real.

Case object distance < f the image is Larger, erect, virtual.

We can see here that the Image formation in all the 5 case is (real image) upside down but in last Image formation, there’s a virtual image formed that's why in only in that case it is upright ⬆ !
